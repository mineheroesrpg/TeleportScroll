# TeleportScroll
Teleport scrolls in Diablo II style

What is TeleportScroll?
This plugin allows you to set teleport points to your cities and allows the players to teleport into the city,
and then back to its previous location, like in Diablo II.
Perfect for RPG servers.



# Usage:
You can create teleport points for example to cities or other important places on your server, 
and than you can get scrolls for these locations.
Sell these scrolls in the in-game shop, or allows the players to gets them by command.
When the player right-clicks with the scroll, it will teleport him into the location that you created before, and open a teleport gate, 
which he can use to go back to his previous location. simple isn't it?
